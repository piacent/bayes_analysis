# bayes_analysis

This github page contains a R jupyter notebook for model comparison on DAMA residuals in the Bayesian approach,
as published in https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03340.
In particular it contains the analysis on pseudodata generated from a cosine modulated dataset, a pure sawtooth
generated dataset and a mixed sawtooth plus cosine modulated dataset. The three .bug files contain the BUG
models employed in the analysis.
